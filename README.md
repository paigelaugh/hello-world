# hello-world
My first repository; location to store ideas &amp; resources throughout my use of GitHub.

Hi everyone!

My name's Paige, and I love cats, cooking, and reading!

I'm so excited to learn more about GitHub so I can get started with learning R and RStudio!
My goal is to expand my data analysis toolbox so I am a more well-rounded lab rat lol!

Can't wait to be on this journey with you all!
